# PropertyOS Development Plan

Last updated: 2026-06-21

This plan turns the current audit findings into an execution roadmap for completing PropertyOS as a merged frontend/backend platform. It covers confirmed defects, missing PRD scope, engineering hardening, and release readiness.

## Current State

The project is now organized as a root workspace with:

- `Backend/`: NestJS 11, Prisma 6, PostgreSQL, JWT/OTP auth, Swagger, 24 unit test suites (176 tests), 100+ API endpoints across 18 controllers, 30 Prisma models, 19 enums.
- `Frontend/`: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui components, TanStack Query 5, TanStack Table 8, Zod 4, 12 Playwright E2E test files, ~120 source files.

Confirmed checks:

- Backend unit tests pass: 24 suites, 176 tests.
- Root TypeScript check passes for backend and frontend.
- Frontend Playwright could not be completed in the current environment because local server binding was blocked.
- Lint currently fails because backend ESLint 9 needs a flat `eslint.config.js` or a compatible ESLint version. No ESLint config file exists at `Backend/` root despite ESLint 9.x being installed.

Backend module inventory (22 modules):

- **V1**: Auth, Users, Reference, Buildings, Floors, Units, Contacts, Media, ChangeRequests, Search, Dashboard
- **V2**: Imports, Exports, Map, Clients, Proposals, Tasks, SiteVisits, Deals, Notifications, Audit, Monitoring
- **Infra**: Health, Email (MailModule)

Frontend route groups:

- `(auth)`: login, verify-otp, forgot-password, reset-password
- `(dashboard)`: dashboard, properties (list/new/[id]/[id]/edit), buildings, floors, units, approvals (list/[id]), media, activity, settings, settings/users
- `(v2)`: clients (list/new/[id]/[id]/edit), requirements, deals (list/[id]), tasks (list/[id]), site-visits (list/[id]), proposals, follow-ups, commissions, invoices, reports, map, imports, exports

## Product Goal

Build a secure internal real estate operations platform where:

- Admins manage master property inventory, users, approvals, imports, exports, media, and reports.
- Workers can add new data directly, edit existing data through change requests, and only see assigned geography.
- V1 covers core inventory, approvals, documents, audit, and role/geography access.
- V2 covers clients, requirements, proposals, tasks, follow-ups, site visits, deals, imports, exports, map, and reports.

## Delivery Principles

- Fix broken user-visible workflows before adding more UI.
- Keep frontend and backend contracts explicit and tested.
- Backend authorization is the source of truth.
- Worker geography restrictions must be enforced server-side on every relevant query.
- Every major workflow needs an end-to-end test before it is considered done.
- Avoid mock success states for production workflows.

## Phase 0: Stabilize Tooling and Runtime

Priority: P0

Purpose: Make the monorepo reliably testable before expanding features.

Tasks:

- Add root and workspace validation commands that work consistently.
- Fix backend lint by adding ESLint 9 flat config or pinning ESLint 8. Currently `Backend/package.json` has `"eslint": "^9.0.0"` but no config file exists at `Backend/` root.
- Ensure `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:backend`, and `npm run test:frontend` are documented and working.
- Confirm local dev server ports:
  - Frontend: `3000`
  - Backend: `4000`
  - Playwright frontend test server: `3100` (per `Frontend/playwright.config.ts` line 8/27)
- Remove or clearly mark legacy `Backend/frontend/` as inactive. This folder contains a full Next.js app with `node_modules/` and should be excluded from workspace or deleted.
- Update `Frontend/README.md`; it still contains default Next.js starter text (36 lines of boilerplate).
- Add a root `docs/` index if more delivery docs are added.
- Audit and remove unused `next-auth` dependency from `Frontend/package.json` (installed but `AuthProvider` is a no-op pass-through at `Frontend/src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`).

Acceptance criteria:

- `npm run typecheck` passes.
- `npm run lint` passes or fails only on intentional tracked warnings.
- `npm run test:backend` passes.
- `npm run test:frontend` starts its own server and runs in a normal local environment.
- README instructions match the current monorepo.
- Legacy `Backend/frontend/` is removed or clearly marked inactive.
- `Frontend/README.md` reflects the actual project setup.

## Phase 1: Fix Blocking Workflow Defects

Priority: P0

Purpose: Fix flows that currently fail or present false success.

### 1. Add Property End-to-End

Current issue:

- `Frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/properties/new/page.tsx` (line 147-155) validates local state, shows success toast, and redirects without creating any backend record.
- `Frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/properties/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (line 100-108) same issue on update.
- `Frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/properties/[id]/page.tsx` (line 102-105) delete handler only shows toast without calling API.
- The `useCreateProperty()` hook exists in `use-properties.ts` (line 104-110) but is never called by the form.

Tasks:

- Convert Add Property submit to real API calls using existing `useCreateProperty()` hook.
- Support all entry types:
  - Building -> `POST /buildings` (backend: `buildings.controller.ts` line 90)
  - Floor -> `POST /buildings/:buildingId/floors` (backend: `floors.controller.ts` line 39)
  - Unit -> `POST /units` (backend: `units.controller.ts` line 51)
- Replace hard-coded constants in `properties/new/page.tsx` with backend reference data from `GET /reference/property-types`, `GET /reference/furnishing-statuses`, `GET /reference/availability-statuses`, `GET /reference/verification-statuses`.
- Add building selection dropdown for floor/unit creation.
- Add floor selection dropdown for unit creation.
- Create contact records after entity creation via `POST /contacts`.
- Attach uploaded media/documents after entity creation via `POST /media/upload-url` + `POST /media/complete-upload`.
- Add proper loading, error, and retry states (currently no loading indicator during submit).
- Prevent success toast unless backend creation succeeds.
- Fix property detail delete to call `useDeleteProperty()` and confirm via dialog before deletion.
- Fix property edit to call `useUpdateProperty()` on submit.

Acceptance criteria:

- Admin can create building, floor, and unit from UI.
- Worker can create new building, floor, and unit from UI.
- Created records appear in list and detail screens.
- Failed API calls show actionable errors.
- Property edit saves to backend.
- Property delete removes from backend.
- E2E test covers successful building creation.

### 2. Worker Geography Enforcement

Current issue:

- `GeographyGuard` (`Backend/src/shared/guards/geography.guard.ts`) prepares scope and attaches `request.userGeographicScope`, but inventory controllers and services do not consistently apply it.
- The `@GEOGRAPHY_SCOPE` decorator is available (`Backend/src/shared/decorators/geography-scope.decorator.ts`) but its usage needs to be verified across all controllers.

Tasks:

- Audit every controller for `@UseGuards(GeographyGuard)` and `@GEOGRAPHY_SCOPE()` decorator usage.
- Apply geography guard/decorator to buildings, floors, units, contacts, media, change requests, search, dashboard, and map APIs.
- Pass `userGeographicScope` into service query builders.
- Add additive scope logic:
  - State assignments include all cities/localities in state.
  - City assignments include all localities in city.
  - Locality assignments include only that locality.
- Ensure direct `GET /:id` access also checks geography.
- Ensure Worker cannot access unassigned sensitive contact data by ID manipulation.
- Add unit tests for query filters.
- Add API integration tests for allowed and denied geographies.

Acceptance criteria:

- Worker list APIs only return assigned records.
- Worker direct-ID access outside scope returns `403` or `404`.
- Admin remains unrestricted.
- Tests prove state, city, and locality assignment behavior.

### 3. Approval Detail Correctness

Current issue:

- `Frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/approvals/[id]/page.tsx` (line 41-49) initializes `fieldStatuses` state using `useState` with `approval?.fieldChanges`, but `approval` is still `undefined` at initial render because it loads asynchronously. This means `fieldStatuses` starts as an empty object.

Tasks:

- Initialize field statuses after approval data loads using a `useEffect` that syncs `fieldStatuses` when `approval` changes.
- Add explicit field selection controls (checkboxes per field).
- Disable approve selected when no fields are selected.
- Add edit-final-value control per field.
- Add defer control per field.
- Show conflict state and resolution action when applicable.
- Keep admin comment per action or per field where needed.
- Refresh query state after approval/rejection.

Acceptance criteria:

- Admin can approve all fields.
- Admin can reject all fields.
- Admin can approve selected fields.
- Admin can edit a proposed value before approving.
- Admin can defer a field.
- Worker receives correct resulting status.
- E2E test covers partial approval.

### 4. Proposal Creation Contract

Current issue:

- Frontend sends `unitIds: []`, while backend rejects proposals with no valid units.
- `Frontend/src/app/(v2)/proposals/page.tsx` needs a full builder flow.

Tasks:

- Add proposal builder flow:
  - Select client (from `GET /clients`).
  - Select requirement (from client's requirements).
  - Search/select units (from `GET /units` or `GET /search/units`).
  - Reorder selected units.
  - Choose client-facing fields.
  - Preview.
  - Save draft.
- Align frontend validation with backend DTO (`Backend/src/modules/proposals/dto/proposals.schema.ts`).
- Add PDF generation and download from UI via `POST /proposals/:id/generate-pdf`.
- Add Excel generation if backend supports it, or add backend support.
- Add send-email backend endpoint or remove UI promise until implemented.
- Ensure confidential fields are excluded.

Acceptance criteria:

- Proposal can be created with at least one unit.
- Proposal PDF can be generated and downloaded.
- Proposal preview hides owner phones, internal notes, brokerage, and audit data.
- E2E test covers proposal draft creation.

### 5. Map Contract and Real Map

Current issue:

- Frontend expects `city`, `status`, `lat`, `lng` on `MapProperty` interface (`Frontend/src/app/(v2)/map/page.tsx` line 31-42), but backend `MapService` (`Backend/src/modules/map/map.service.ts` line 14-31) returns only `id, name, buildingCode, latitude, longitude, availabilityStatus.name` — missing `city`, `locality`, `type`, `area`, `rent`.
- UI is a placeholder map with pseudo-positioned pins using index modulo math (`map/page.tsx` line 131-133: `left: \`${10 + (i * 17) % 80}%\``).

Tasks:

- Decide map provider: Google Maps, Mapbox, or OpenStreetMap/Leaflet.
- Normalize backend map response DTO to include: `id`, `name`, `buildingCode`, `city` (from relation), `locality` (from relation), `latitude`, `longitude`, `status` (from `availabilityStatus`), `propertyType`, `availableArea`, `monthlyRent`.
- Update `MapService.findByBounds()` and `MapService.findNearby()` to include `city`, `locality`, `propertyType`, and unit summary fields in the select clause.
- Replace pseudo-positioned pins with real coordinates.
- Implement bounds query with proper viewport passing.
- Implement radius search via `GET /map/properties/nearby`.
- Add clustering for dense areas.
- Add property preview drawer.
- Add open detail action.

Acceptance criteria:

- Real map renders in desktop and mobile.
- Pins are placed by real coordinates.
- Bounds and radius filters call backend.
- Clicking a pin opens a property preview.

### 6. Settings Profile Update

Current issue:

- Frontend (`Frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` line 23) calls `PATCH /auth/me`, but backend only exposes `GET /auth/me` (`Backend/src/modules/auth/auth.controller.ts` line 124-132). There is no `PATCH` handler.
- Settings page shows hardcoded phone number `"+91 98765 43210"` (line 89).
- Password change shows a toast "sent to your email" without calling any backend endpoint (line 36).
- Notification preferences are not persisted anywhere (lines 114-131).

Tasks:

- Add backend `PATCH /auth/me` endpoint in `auth.controller.ts` and `auth.service.ts`.
- Validate allowed editable profile fields (fullName, email).
- Prevent users from changing role/status through profile endpoint.
- Remove hardcoded phone number or add phone field to backend profile if applicable.
- Connect password change to actual `POST /auth/forgot-password` flow.
- Persist notification preferences or remove the UI until backend support exists.
- Add success/error UI.

Acceptance criteria:

- User can update permitted profile fields.
- Unauthorized or invalid profile updates are rejected.
- No hardcoded data in settings form.

### 7. Mock Auth Routes

Current issue:

- `Frontend/src/app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.ts` (line 24) sets `mock-jwt-token` as the auth-session cookie. Accepts any 6-digit OTP.
- `Frontend/src/app/api/auth/send-otp/route.ts` just logs to console.
- `Frontend/src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts` just logs to console.
- All three have `TODO: Integrate with actual` comments.

Tasks:

- Remove server-side mock auth API routes or redirect them to backend endpoints.
- Ensure frontend auth hooks (`use-auth.ts`) call backend `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/verify-email-otp`, `POST /auth/forgot-password`, `POST /auth/reset-password` directly.
- Verify token storage and refresh flow works with real backend.
- Remove or replace `AuthProvider` no-op (`Frontend/src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`).

Acceptance criteria:

- Login flow uses real backend OTP.
- Password reset flow uses real backend endpoints.
- No mock tokens are set in cookies.

### 8. Mock Activity and Notifications

Current issue:

- `Frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/activity/page.tsx` (lines 7-85) uses entirely hardcoded `MOCK_ACTIVITY` data.
- `Frontend/src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx` (lines 17-23) uses hardcoded `MOCK_NOTIFICATIONS`.
- `Frontend/src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx` (lines 25-55) uses hardcoded `SEARCH_RESULTS` for Cmd+K search.

Tasks:

- Replace activity page mock data with real API calls to `GET /audit` endpoint.
- Add filters (user, date range, entity type, event type).
- Replace notification mock data with real API calls or remove the notifications dropdown until backend notification system is ready.
- Replace Cmd+K search with real search API calls to `GET /search/properties`, `GET /search/contacts`.
- Remove hardcoded search results.

Acceptance criteria:

- Activity page shows real audit data.
- Notifications dropdown shows real data or is hidden.
- Cmd+K search returns real results.

### 9. Import Upload URL Mismatch

Current issue:

- `Frontend/src/hooks/use-imports.ts` (line 32) defaults to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1` instead of `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`.
- UI says "Supports .csv, .xlsx" but backend only parses CSV.

Tasks:

- Fix default URL to use `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`.
- Add XLSX parsing support in backend or remove XLSX from frontend until supported.
- Ensure import upload works end-to-end.

Acceptance criteria:

- Import upload reaches the correct backend endpoint.
- File type support matches between frontend and backend.

### 10. Export Entity Type Mismatch

Current issue:

- Frontend export types (`Frontend/src/app/(v2)/exports/page.tsx` lines 19-48) use `"properties"`, `"clients"`, `"deals"`, `"requirements"` but backend `GET /exports/:entityType` needs to accept these values.
- Backend export returns JSON array, not CSV string.

Tasks:

- Verify backend export endpoint accepts frontend entity type values.
- Add CSV generation in backend export service.
- Add XLSX generation if needed.
- Align response format with frontend expectations.

Acceptance criteria:

- Export download works for all entity types.
- Downloaded file is valid CSV or XLSX.

## GitHub and Deployment Track

The unified codebase should be published as a new repository rather than using the existing separate backend/frontend repositories.

Recommended repository:

- `anmolsansi/Property-OS`

Repository contents should include:

- Root workspace files.
- `Backend/` source, Prisma schema, docs, tests, and config.
- `Frontend/` source, public assets, tests, and config.
- Root `docs/`.
- Root `.env.example`.
- Root `.gitignore`.

Repository contents should exclude:

- `node_modules/`
- `.next/`
- `dist/`
- coverage reports
- logs
- local `.env` files
- nested `.git/` directories
- generated test artifacts

Initial GitHub setup tasks:

- Create the new repository.
- Push a clean initial commit from a temporary export or from a converted root repo.
- Add repository description.
- Add topics: `nestjs`, `nextjs`, `prisma`, `property-management`, `real-estate`, `typescript`.
- Add branch protection after CI is working.
- Add GitHub Actions for:
  - install
  - typecheck

  - backend tests
  - frontend tests
  - build.
- Add issue labels:
  - `P0`
  - `P1`
  - `P2`
  - `backend`
  - `frontend`
  - `auth`
  - `inventory`
  - `approvals`
  - `media`
  - `v2`
  - `testing`
  - `security`
  - `deployment`.

Deployment options:

- Local Docker Compose for development infrastructure.
- Low-cost VPS deployment for early internal testing.
- Vercel frontend plus containerized backend for faster frontend preview deployments.
- Full container deployment for staging and production.

Initial deployment target recommendation:

- Publish code to GitHub first.
- Add CI next.
- Deploy staging only after Phase 0 and the P0 contract fixes are complete.
- Do not deploy production until geography authorization, auth, media privacy, backups, and audit logging are verified.
